# Introduction

Hi! This is my **Excel Portfolio Project**. Here I'm working with a Dataset
that contains Traveling‚úàÔ∏è Ô∏èdetails of people with various demographic factors like age, gender, 
marital status, occupation etc. The project involves **Cleaning & Transforming** Dataset, creating 
**Pivot Tables** and **Pivot Charts** to extract meaningfully information and represent it graphically,
creation of **Dashboard** with additional filters that interactively connected to charts!

# Cleaning & Transforming Dataset

First step was to **Clean & Transform** Dataset, so it is fully prepared for further work.  
This is what part of this raw dataset looks like before any changes:

To bring this dataset into convenient and clean form‚ú® I deleted duplicates, rounded and formated currency values, 
categorized continuous data into more manageable groups, such as age ranges and income brackets replaced, replaced 
abbreviations with full words for better presentation in later created charts, formatted the entire dataset as a table to give 
it a more presentable look + expanded functionality such as filters, drop down lists etc.

This is how dataset looks after all these changes:

# Creating Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts

Second step was to create Pivot Tables to extract meaningfully information from the dataset. In total, 6 Pivot tablesüìÖ 
were created. 
Then I created Pivot Charts based on these Pivot Tables to represent them graphically.  
For example, here is two **Pivot Tables** and **Pivot Charts**:

First Pivot Tables represents average quantity of trips per year by amount of childrenüë∂üèª person has!  
Second represents average quantity of trips‚úàÔ∏è per year by age group!

You can see **other 4 pivot tables and charts** in  the actual Excel file   
that you can download from this repository or by this link:
[Excel Travel Analysis Project](Travel%20Analysis%20(Excel%20Portfolio%20Project).xlsx).

# Creating Dashboard

And the last step was to combine all Pivot Charts into one nice **Dashboard**üìà with additional filters 
that interactively connected to charts!  
Here it is:

# Conclusion

This Excel project showcases the process of **Cleaning & Transforming** Dataset, creating 
**Pivot Tables** and **Pivot Charts** and combining it all in nice interactive **Dashboard**!
