# Introduction

Hi! This is my **Excel Portfolio Project**. Here I'm working with a DatasetðŸ“…
that contains Traveling details of people with various demographic factors like age, gender, 
marital status, occupation etc. The project involves cleaning & transforming dataset, creating 
**Pivot Tables** and **Pivot Charts** to extract meaningfully information and represent it graphically,
creation of **Dashboard** with additional filters that interactively connected to charts!
