# Introduction

Hi! This is my **Excel Portfolio Project**. Here I'm working with a DatasetðŸ“…
that contains Traveling details of people with various demographic factors like age, gender, 
marital status, occupation etc. The project involves cleaning & transforming dataset, creating 
**Pivot Tables** and **Pivot Charts** to extract meaningfully information and represent it graphically,
creation of **Dashboard** with additional filters that interactively connected to charts!

# Cleaning & Transforming Dataset

First step was to **Clean & Transform** Dataset, so it is fully prepared for further work.  
This is what part of this raw dataset looks like before any changes:

To bring this dataset into convinient and clean form I deleted duplicates, rounded and formated currency values, 
categorized continuous data into more manageable groups, such as age ranges and income brackets replaced, replaced 
abbreviations with full words for better presentation in later created charts, formatted the entire dataset as a table to give 
it a more presentable look + expanded functionality such as filters, drop down lists etc.

This is how dataset looks after all these changes:
